h1. SpreeSlider

Add a slider to the homepage of your spree site

h2. Installation

To install, add spree_slider to your @Gemfile@ and run `bundle install`:

<pre>
gem 'spree_slider'
</pre>

This extension uses two sliders plugins: Nivo and Anything slider
Depending on which plugin you want to install, run the following command:

h3. Anything slider

<pre>
rails generate spree_slider:install_anything
</pre>

h3. Nivo slider

<pre>
rails generate spree_slider:install_nivo
</pre>

The slider is almost unstyled. To customize you have to add your own css and
eventually modify the partial copied into your app folder:
app/views/shared/_slider.html.erb


h3. Dynamic content

To add dynamic content, go to the spree admin section, under 'Configuration'
and find the Spree Slider menu.
